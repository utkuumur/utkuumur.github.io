excerpt: 'Database migration is an important problem faced by companies deal-
ing with big data. Not only is migration a costly procedure, it involves serious
security risks as well. For some institutions, the primary focus is on reducing the
cost of the migration operation, which manifests itself in application testing. For
other institutions, minimizing security risks is the most important goal, especially
if the data involved is of a sensitive nature. In the literature, the database mi-
gration problem has been studied from a test cost minimization perspective. In
this paper, we focus on an orthogonal measure, i.e., security risk minimization.
We associate security with the number of shifts needed to complete the migration
task. Ideally, we want to complete the migration in as few shifts as possible, so
that the risk of data exposure is minimized. In this paper, we provide a formal
framework for studying the database migration problem from the perspective of
security risk minimization (shift minimization) and establish the computational
complexities of several models in the same. For the NP-hard models, we develop
memetic algorithms that produce solutions that are within 10% and 7% of the
optimal in 95% of the instances under 8 and 82 seconds, respectively.'

**Abstract:** Database migration is an important problem faced by companies deal-
ing with big data. Not only is migration a costly procedure, it involves serious
security risks as well. For some institutions, the primary focus is on reducing the
cost of the migration operation, which manifests itself in application testing. For
other institutions, minimizing security risks is the most important goal, especially
if the data involved is of a sensitive nature. In the literature, the database mi-
gration problem has been studied from a test cost minimization perspective. In
this paper, we focus on an orthogonal measure, i.e., security risk minimization.
We associate security with the number of shifts needed to complete the migration
task. Ideally, we want to complete the migration in as few shifts as possible, so
that the risk of data exposure is minimized. In this paper, we provide a formal
framework for studying the database migration problem from the perspective of
security risk minimization (shift minimization) and establish the computational
complexities of several models in the same. For the NP-hard models, we develop
memetic algorithms that produce solutions that are within 10% and 7% of the
optimal in 95% of the instances under 8 and 82 seconds, respectively.
