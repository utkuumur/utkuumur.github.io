excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a novel method for the prior-art search
task. We fine-tune SciBERT transformer model using Triplet Net-
work approach, allowing us to represent each patent with a fixed-
size vector. This also enables us to conduct efficient vector similar-
ity computations to rank patents in query time. In our experiments,
we show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods.'

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a novel method for the prior-art search
task. We fine-tune SciBERT transformer model using Triplet Net-
work approach, allowing us to represent each patent with a fixed-
size vector. This also enables us to conduct efficient vector similar-
ity computations to rank patents in query time. In our experiments,
we show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods.
