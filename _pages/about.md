Hi! Iâ€™m Utku. I am an MS student at TOBB University of Economics and Technology in the Department of Computer Engineering. My research interests are Algorithms, Combinatorial Optimization, and applications of   Natural Language Processing in economics. Lately, I have been interested in using machine learning to algorithmic discovery and combinatorial optimization.
