Hi! Iâ€™m Utku.

I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by Prof. Carla Gomes. My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, and Scientific Problem Solving. I am particularly interested in scientific challenges involving combinatorial structures, such as structure identification and molecular fragmentation.

On another front, I develop machine learning-based algorithmic approaches for combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems, aiming to create efficient methods for solving complex decision-making and reasoning tasks.

Additionally, I explore how large-scale text data, such as patents and lawsuits, can be leveraged for research in economics and finance, using AI to extract meaningful insights from legal and financial documents.

I am excited about pushing the boundaries of AI-driven discovery and collaborating across disciplines to tackle challenging problems.
