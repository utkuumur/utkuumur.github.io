2022-04-01	Accepted in	1	Intellectual Property Protection Lost and Competition:  An Examination Using Machine Learning	NBER Summer Institute Innovation/Productivity meeting, EFA	We examine the impact of lost intellectual property protection on innovation, competition, mergers and acquisitions and employment agreements. We consider firms whose ability to protect intellectual property (IP) using patents is potentially invalidated following the Alice vs. CLS Bank International Supreme Court decision. This decision has impacted patents in multiple areas including business methods, software, and bioinformatics. We use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to identify firms' existing patent portfolios' potential exposure to the Alice decision. While all affected firms decrease patenting post-Alice, we find an unequal impact of decreased patent protection. Large affected firms benefit as their sales and market valuations increase, and their exposure to lawsuits through patent trolls decrease. They also acquire fewer firms post-Alice. Small affected firms lose as they face increased competition, product market encroachment, and lower profits and valuations. They increase R&D and have their employees sign more nondisclosure and noncompete agreements.

In this work, we explore whether descriptions of procurement calls can be used to predict their outcomes. In particular, we focus on predicting four well-known economic metrics: i) the number of offers, ii) whether only a single offer is received, iii) whether a foreign firm is awarded the contract, and iv) whether the contract price exceeds the expected price. We extract the European Union's multilingual public procurement notices, covering 22 different languages. We investigate fine-tuning multilingual transformer models and propose two approaches: 1) multilayer perceptron models (MLP) with transformer embeddings for each business sector in which the training data is filtered based on the procurement category and 2) a KNN based approach fine-tuned using Triplet Networks. The fine-tuned MBERT model outperforms all other models in predicting calls with a single offer and foreign contract awards, whereas our MLP based filtering approach yields state-of-the-art results in predicting contracts in which the contract price exceeds the expected price. Furthermore, our KNN based approach outperforms all the baselines in all tasks and our other proposed models in predicting the number of offers. Moreover, we investigate cross-lingual and multilingual training for our tasks and observe that multilingual training improves prediction accuracy in all our tasks. Overall, our experiments suggest that notice descriptions play an important role in outcomes of public procurement calls.	(Submitted) Acikalin, U. U.,  Gorgun, M. K.,  Kutlu, M.,  Tas,  B. K.
